-> Performance Optimization
-> Limit Rate of Function Call

Example 1 - A search bar on e-commerce website

Debouncing
Make API call if the time difference between 2 keypresses is > 300ms

Throttling
When you make an API call wait for a certain period of time after then you can
make a function call

In this scenario Debouncing is used

Example 2 - Track How frequent User is Resizing Browser Window

Both Debouncing and Throttling can be used here

Example 3 - On Button click (Shooting Game)

Throttling makes more sense
