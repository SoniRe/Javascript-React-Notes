Event delegation is based on event bubbling. Event Delegation helps in increasing 
performance of web page with lots of events

Event Delegation it states that instead attaching event handlers to each event we should attach event 
handler to parent element

document.getElementById("category").addEventListener("click", (e) => {
  console.log(e.target.id);

  if (e.target.tagName == "LI") window.location.href = "/" + e.target.id;
});


// Behaviour Pattern
document.getElementById("form").addEventListener("keyup", (e) => {
  console.log(e);

  if (e.target.dataset.uppercase !== undefined) {
    e.target.value = e.target.value.toUpperCase();
  }
});

// Benefits of Event Delegation
1) Saves a lot of memory
2) It also mitigates the risk of performance bottlenecks
3) Less Code
4) Efficient DOM Manipulation

// Limitations 
1) All the events are not bubbled up like blur(), focus(), windowresize()
2) Stop propogation may cause a problem with event delegation
