CORS - CORS tells the browser whether one web app can share resources with another web app. It tells
that you can share data with same origin by default

Before CORS
1) Not to different domain
2) Not to sub domain
3) Neither different ports
4) Neither different protocols were allowed

With CORS we can share data with it

Preflight option call is made before actual call

HTTP Headers
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * [Any domain outside this can access]
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET

Does CORS happen for all request ?
No, Browser doesn't do it for simple requests

To avoid CORS this
Set header to all origins from server
