When you pass a function in a function it is called callback function

Due to callbacks we can do async tasks

What is a Callback Function in Javascript
setTimeout(function () {
  console.log("Callback");
}, 5000);

function x(y) {
  console.log("fnc is x");
  y();
}

x(function y() {
  console.log("fnc is y");
});

function y is called back after some time

Blocking the main thread
We should never block our main thread / call stack
We should use async operation that takes time

Event Listener

function attachEventListeners() {
  let count = 0;

  document.getElementById("clickMe").addEventListener("click", function () {
    console.log("Button Clicked", count);
    count++;
  });
}

attachEventListeners();

Closure Demo with Event Listener

Garbage collection and removeEventListener

Why do we need to event listener
event listeners are heavy it takes memory and makes closure so thats why we 
remove event listener and it is garbage collected
