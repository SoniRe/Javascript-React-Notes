 -> What is Closure ?
    A closure is a function together with reference to its lexical environment 
 
 -> Explain a little bit more about it ?
    It's like each and every function has access to its lexical environment. Example access to variables of its parent 

 -> Will this code work considering x is let which is block scoped

	function outer() {
	  let a = 10;

	  function inner() {
 	   console.log(a);
 	 }
	
	  return inner;  
	}

	var fnc = outer();

	fnc();
   
     It will still form a closure and won't give error and it will work same even if we give parameter to function

 -> Conflicting global name what will happen in this case ?
    It will work just fine and reference to variable which is closest

 -> How to make scalable and large application with closure
    Using constructor function 
    
	function Counter() {
  	var count = 0;

  	this.incrementCounter = function () {
    	count++;
    	console.log(count);
  	};

  	this.decrementCounter = function () {
    	count--;
    	console.log(count);
  	};
	}

	var counter1 = new Counter();

	counter1.incrementCounter();
	counter1.decrementCounter();
