function x() {
  var i = 1;
  setTimeout(function () {
    console.log(i);
  }, 1000);
  console.log("Namaste Javascript");
}

Closure is formed inside function and it remembers i variable After that and setTimeout function takes this callback function
and attaches it to a timer and it stores it somwehere and Javascript proceeds

After the timer runs out Javascript again puts it in the call stack and runs it
