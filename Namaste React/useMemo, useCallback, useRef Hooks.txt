useMemo() - Hook that can increase your application's performance

useMemo is a React Hook that lets you cache the result of a calculation between re-renders.

React is very fast for small operations but it gets slow when doing high calculations

  // Heavy Operation
  // We memoise the heavy operation

  const prime = useMemo(() => {
    console.log("render", text);
    return nthPrime(text);
  }, [text]);

useCallback() - Also helps in increasing applications performance

useCallback is a React Hook that lets you cache a function definition between re-renders.

useRef is a React Hook that lets you reference a value thatâ€™s not needed for rendering.

It lets normal variable persist value after every re-render and not set it to default value
