-> Zerodha(Stock Market) , Whatsapp
-> Time Critical Application or which needs very real time

2nd Option

-> Handle Data using API Polling 
-> Data is sent from server to UI 
-> Data is Unidrectional or Single Directional

-> Cricbuzz uses API Polling after every 25s data is fetched from backend
-> Don't need real time data
