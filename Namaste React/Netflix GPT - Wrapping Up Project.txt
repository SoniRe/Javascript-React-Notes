        search: string;
        placeholder: string;
    };
    spanish: {
        search: string;
        placeholder: string;
    };

I am calling my OPEN AI from react which is client side and not backend.
At client side secret key / API key can be leaked

Best Parctice is to do through node server or Backend

saving Key Safely in .env file
REACT_APP_GEMINI_KEY="AIzaSyBLAva2RH8oFzD-ir5QMf-o6upOwy0dfFE";

Used Memoization so that we dont API call as soon as we switch  in our App ✅

Making it scalable, if there are 1000's of students they are navigating back and forth we are reducing API calls a lot making it scalable
